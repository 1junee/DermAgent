Thought: I need to begin by observing the image to identify any clinically relevant skin conditions, lesions, or abnormalities. The image shows the back of a horse’s head with arrows pointing to specific areas: one to the dorsal midline (black arrow), one to the top of the head near the ears (red arrow), and one to the mane (white arrow). Since this is an animal image, I must consider whether any dermatological condition is present or if this is a normal anatomical feature. I will use the observe_image tool to extract clinical features.

The image provided is of a horse’s head, and the arrows point to anatomical features rather than skin lesions or dermatological abnormalities. There is no visible evidence of skin disease, infection, or pathological condition. The arrows indicate the dorsal midline (black arrow), the top of the head near the ears (red arrow), and the mane (white arrow), which are all normal anatomical landmarks in equine anatomy.

Since no dermatological lesion or condition is present, and the image is of an animal (horse), the appropriate conclusion is that there is no definitive skin disease to diagnose. The request for a dermatology diagnosis is not applicable here, as the subject is not human.

Thought: No dermatological lesion or disease is visible in the image. The arrows indicate normal anatomical features of a horse’s head. No diagnosis can be made as this is not a human skin condition.

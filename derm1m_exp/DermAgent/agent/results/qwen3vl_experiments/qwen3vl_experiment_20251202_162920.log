This pattern is consistent with a hair disease, likely related to stress, infection, or nutritional deficiency. No nail involvement, exogenous agents, hereditary patterns, inflammatory signs (e.g., erythema, scaling), proliferative lesions, or reaction patterns are evident."

    "reasoning": "The image shows a distinct patch of hair loss on the scalp with surrounding normal hair, consistent with the typical presentation of alopecia areata. The abrupt demarcation and absence of scarring or inflammation suggest an autoimmune cause rather than cicatricial or other forms of alopecia."

The absence of specific morphology, color, or distribution details prevents confident diagnosis of Alopecia areata. Other differentials like traction or scarring alopecia remain possible but are not confirmed without additional clinical context or histopathology."

Thought: I need to begin by observing the image to extract clinical features such as morphology, color, distribution, surface features, and body location. This will help me identify any skin conditions, lesions, or abnormalities.

The initial observation tool did not extract any clinical features from the image, likely because the image is of a horse’s back and tail, not human skin. The arrows point to areas of hair loss, pigmentation, and possibly skin texture changes, but these are not human dermatological findings. Since the image is not of human skin, no dermatological diagnosis can be made using the provided ontology.
